🧠 AI-Powered Knowledge Engine for Smart Support and Ticket Resolution

This AI-driven system automates support ticket handling and streamlines resolution using Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand user queries, fetch relevant knowledge from a dynamic database, and generate accurate, context-aware responses 💬. The system continuously learns from past interactions to enhance precision, reduce response time, and minimize human intervention ⚡.

Key Features:

🔍 RAG-based Query Understanding – Retrieves and integrates the most relevant knowledge before generating responses

🤖 Automated Ticket Classification & Resolution – Automatically categorizes and resolves tickets for faster support

📚 Dynamic Knowledge Base Management – Updates and searches the knowledge repository efficiently

💡 AI-Generated, Context-Aware Responses – Provides human-like, accurate replies to user queries

📈 Continuous Learning & Performance Tracking – Improves over time using historical interactions and analytics

🛠️ User-Friendly Dashboard – Enables managers and agents to monitor support metrics and ticket trends
